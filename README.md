# ECF DP project for Kura

This project simply re-packages a new ECF OSGi management functionality into an OSGi DP which is used by Kura.

This is considered a proof-of-concept!

And it will only work with my experimental [equinox_neon_1](https://github.com/ctron/kura/tree/feature/equinox_neon_1) branch of Kura
